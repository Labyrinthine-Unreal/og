[Labyrinthine Unreal](https://www.labyrinthineunreal.io/) is a game of mystery and exploration, and the subterranean space of Merca City. Players may move between worlds through hidden portals that can be accessed from a personal tablet (each player is equipped with one at the beginning of the game).

It organizes 3D digital events, collects notable works of art, and designs, creates, curates, and manages art galleries for its members and collectors. TaurosDAO also provides a number of services for established and startup projects in the web3 and digital space (see page [#]).
